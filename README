[General Introduction]
    The Best Performance VHBR Reader going to start appearing on the scene 
	
	Today, FEITIAN announced the product availability of smart card reader able to support the world’s fastest electronic passports (ePassports), which implements the state-of-the-art VHBR (Very High Bit Rates) contactless 
technology required in ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) LDS 2.0 Standard. Driving a new technology requires early availability and FEITIAN has been dedicated in supplying high-performance and high-quality smart 
card  reader  portfolio  to  promote  outstanding  high-speed  communication  in  both  Reader–to-Card  and Card-to-Reader direction     
The Fastest Processing Speed perfect match for next-generation ePassport generations 

	The VHBR protocol improves the stability of contactless communication between the electronic passport and the corresponding reader. To be able to process immigration security checks as efficiently as possible despite the 
increased  amount  of  data,  the  VHBR  contactless  technology  enables  eight  times  faster  contactless  processing speed by electronic readers. To the benefit of both travelers and airport operators, passport data can be read at 
fastest speed by contactless readers at electronic checkpoints in airports. 
 
	The Industry’s First VHBR CCID reader offering maximum compatibility and flexibility The USB CCID class driver reduces the need for hardware vendors to create a device-specific driver for smart card 
readers.  Eliminating  the  need  for  a  device-specific  driver  will  potentially  reduce  the  driver  development  cost, improve driver and system stability, reduce time to market, and lead to a simplified plug and play experience for 
customers using devices compliant with the USB Chip/Smart Card Interface Devices (CCID) Specification.
